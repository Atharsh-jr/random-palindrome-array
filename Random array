# random-palindrome-array
XYZ shopping mall wants to distribute lucky coupon for its customers. Each lucky coupon has some
prize amount. The mall executive wants to pick 100 order numbers randomly. The order number lies 
between 1000 and 9999. Design a java application which helps the executive to determine the winners 
of lucky coupon. The customer is winner if order number is palindrome and if it belongs to those 100 
randomly picked one.
Program
import java.util.Random;
public class Array {
 public static void main(String args[]) {
 int min = 1000; 
 int max = 9999; 
 int ordernum[] = new int[100];
 Random r = new Random();
 for(int i =0; i<100;i++)
 {
 ordernum[i] = r.nextInt((max - min) + 1) + min;
 }
 for(int i=0; i < ordernum.length; i++)
 {
 int number = ordernum[i];
 int reversedNumber = 0;
 int temp=0;
 while(number > 0)
 {
 temp = number % 10;
 number = number / 10;
 reversedNumber = reversedNumber * 10 + temp;
 }
 if(ordernum[i] == reversedNumber)
 System.out.println("The customer with order number"+" "+ordernum[i]+" "+ "won the lucky 
coupon");
 
 }
 }
}
Output
The customer with order number 4224 won the lucky coupon
The customer with order number 8888 won the lucky coupon
